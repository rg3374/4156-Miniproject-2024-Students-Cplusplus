Bugs found in Unit Test
------------------------
1. Department.cpp: getDepartmentChair() returns "departmentChair". 
   Fixed to return departmentChair

2. Course.cpp: No get function for enrolledStudentCount
   Added Course::getEnrolledStudentCount()

3. Course::enrollStudent() doesn't check against enrollmentCapacity
   Check added. Return true or false accordingly

4. Course::dropStudent() doesn't check against zero
   Check added. Return true or false accordingly

5. In Course constructor enrolledStudentCount is initialized as 500. It should be zero. Fixed.

6. Course::getCourseTimeSlot() returned instructorName. Fixed.

7. Course::getInstructorName() returned courseTimeSlot. Fixed.

8. Course::isCourseFull() logic is wrong. Should be return enrolledStudentCount > enrollmentCapacity; Fixed.
